I have receieved call of fahad (faddy sheikh software house job olx 0314 233086 in my mob)
that has said that we have a project of node js to be build and then passed phone to yousef (probably his brother) 

in which he said that i have a website to make can you make it for which i said yes I will 
and then he said its like a football match prediction website in which that which team will win 
or lose and its like a betting website i have not clearly understanding at that time so he said
I will give a sample website so you can see it and make like that I said ok you can send

to make is you are interested for which he said yes and then around 7:30 pm I have arrived at his house and then 
we jointly seen the sample website and disscussed for which he said it's a 2 month project mininmum and it will take
a week just to plan how the website to be make and the strategies, I insisted that its too much time you are asking about
but he didn't agreed continuosly saying that project's take a alot of time
I called to yousef at 8:19 pm 3 times after a short break but didn't answered, at 9:08 pm called to fahad sheikh and 
had gotten a response from the same person yousef 




I said that its a lengthy project and it will require two months
he was shocked after hearing so much time and insisted that its only work of 2 weeks 
at that point aniq said can you plz get the call to me 
he disscussed two pages of website and then he said ok will make it in two weeks or atleat 
we will give you the forntend site so you can get more time to from client on which he have agreed 
but noted that he had already lost 3 days prior before calling us so we had to finish it as soon as possible
then he said what will you charge for the project and aniq said will charge 200$(means approx Rs 41,500 at that time) for the 
whole project both front end and backend and after yousef had discussed with his brother he said we have a budget of Rs 40,000
for which we have agreed to work at Rs 40,000 then he said i am also consulting with 3 more developers and I will final you 
after a hour or so
I have then blamed aniq for mentioning himself and regarding me as a fresher to the client and him as a experienced professional
but aniq has not a right answer for which i will calm down




after a short while more at his house while discussing how we will work at the project we go to the food street located
below his house had dinner and then called to yousef but didn't get a response 
at night 12:28 I had recieved a call from yousef finaling the project and said plz be hurry

he has arrived at around 4:30 but due to sunday and 25 december library are closed and we worked at my house 
till around 7:45 pm

and after aniq has gone yousef has called me had a long conversation with him for about 15 min I have 
asked for the payment on which he joint it to the approval of the client and said plz hurry to the project 
so tomorrow evening 5pm (before the agreed time of sending frontend work of 2 days which is till night) so
he will send to the client stating that client's work time will start at our 2pm and he will ask probably for the update
and asked some changes to be made from the sample website with addding features like moving or scrolling of icons etc
